# Github PR Review

Stop wasting time on **code review**.    
Github PR Review is an interface to simplify pull requests management on GitHub.

- **Built for developers**     
Track all pull requests from your teams, or your own pull requests, and do a code review more easier.

- **Sort your pull requests**    
You can use both modes, _label_ or _filter_ and sort your pull requests.

- **Increase your productivity**    
In one single page you have all your watched repositories with the related pull requests and your notifications sorted
by repositories. 

## How to use

### Sort by filters

You can search for issues and pull requests globally across all of GitHub, or search for issues and pull requests within
a particular organization.

### Sort by labels

You can sort you pull requests on four blocks Review needed, Accepted, Changes requested and WIP.    
_Notification view is not possible with this mode_
